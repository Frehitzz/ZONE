# BEGINNER CODESPROUT HACKATHON 2025
## 🌱 CODESPROUT2025  

A simple productivity web app built for my hackathon project.  
It combines a **Pomodoro timer**, a **to-do list**, and a **GitHub-style session tracker** to help students (like me) stay productive, avoid burnout, and keep track of daily progress.

## 🚀 Inspiration  
As a student, I often get overwhelmed with multiple school deadlines.  
I wanted a way to manage my tasks, stay productive, and also track my accomplishments to boost my motivation.  
That’s why I built this project—to help myself (and others) maintain good mental health while studying.
